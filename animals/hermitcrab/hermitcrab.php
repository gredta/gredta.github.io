  <b>Diet &amp; Living Spaces: </b>hermit crab's diet should consist of high-quality commercial hermit crab food, fresh vegetables, and fruit or peanut butter as treats. They should also have a shallow water bowl with fresh water available at all times, including a bowl of saltwater to bathe themselves. The ideal environment for a hermit crab would be in a very large, warm, humid tank with at least 6 inches of moistened substrate mixture with other hermit crab companions. Hermit crabs are very social animals and must be accompanied by other crabs in order to live a happy life. The terrarium must be sprayed with water at least three times daily in order to keep the environment moist and humid. Climbing walls, toys, and hideaways should be scattered throughout the terrarium to encourage exercise as well. Their terrarium should also have at least 3 natural empty shells for every hermit crab in the tank of various sizes so that when the crabs molt and outgrow their old shell they can find a new shell fit into it instead of outgrowing their old shell and being uncomfortable.</p>

It's not as much of a health problem as it is an owner's lack of knowledge on the matter. More often than not, many hermit crab owners are misinformed about hermit crabs and their living conditions and they are unfortunately placed in very dangerous environments where they are slowly suffocating because the humidity levels are not high enough for them to breathe through their gills easily. This can be combatted by providing a tank humidifier and heater and by spraying the tank multiple times a day with a sprayer filled with fresh water. This animal requires a lot of time and attention in order to get their living environments just right. It's important to keep this in mind if you or someone you know is interested in keeping a hermit crab as a pet.
