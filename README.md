# Personal Portfolio Website ðŸª´
This is a personal portfolio website made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. 
I share some information about myself, my hobbies, and a few of my achievements. 
<p>
This site is being hosted through GitHub Pages, (my favorite!) and it was super fun to build.
I included some cool hovers that I had fun playing around with, some smooth scrolling JavaScript, and some jQuery functions ðŸ˜Ž
<p>
I'll keep updating this site as I work on more projects and coding cool things!
